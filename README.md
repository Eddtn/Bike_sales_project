# Bike Sales Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the bike sales data by exploring factors like income, gender, marital status, occupation, and more to understand purchasing patterns. The data is organized into various sheets for better analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

## Project Structure

- **Bike Buyers**: Contains detailed data of potential bike buyers, including demographics, income, occupation, and bike purchase status.
  
- **WorkingSheet**: Similar to the Bike Buyers sheet, but with an added age bracket column that categorizes individuals into age groups.

- **PivotTable**: A pivot table summarizing average income based on gender and purchase behavior (`Yes`/`No`). This table helps compare income differences among different demographic groups.

- **Dashboard**: Placeholder for a dashboard summarizing key insights from the analysis. Visualizations and key metrics will be added here in future steps.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**: The data is already cleaned and categorized. You can add or modify filters in the `WorkingSheet` to refine the analysis.
   
2. **Pivot Table Analysis**: The `PivotTable` sheet allows a quick look into income distribution and bike purchase trends by gender. You can update the table to explore additional factors.

3. **Dashboard**: This section is intended for visual summaries of key trends. You can use tools like Excel, Power BI, or Tableau to create charts and graphs based on the data in `Bike Buyers` or `WorkingSheet`.





**Insight gotten from this project**

The Bike Sales Analysis Project provides insights into the factors that influence whether a person buys a bike. Below are the key insights based on the available data:

**1. Income and Bike Purchases**
Income Differences: From the PivotTable sheet, it is clear that income varies between those who purchased bikes and those who did not. For example:
Females who bought bikes had an average income of 90,000, whereas those who didn’t have an average income of 92,500.
Males who bought bikes earned an average of 81,666, compared to 105,000 for those who didn’t buy a bike.
Insight: Interestingly, individuals with higher incomes (especially males) are less likely to purchase bikes. This suggests that income may not be a strong positive predictor of bike purchases, and other factors could be more significant.
**2. Gender Differences**
There is a gender divide in the data:
Males, on average, earn more than females, both in the categories of those who purchased and those who did not.
Despite this, males who purchase bikes have lower average incomes than females who do. This is an unusual finding and may suggest that male buyers may be more budget-conscious, while female buyers have a slightly higher threshold for spending on bikes.
**3. Age and Bike Purchases**
The WorkingSheet divides individuals into age brackets:
Most buyers are categorized as "Middle Age" (ages around 36 to 50), indicating that middle-aged individuals might be more likely to buy bikes.
Older individuals (60 and above) are less likely to purchase a bike.
Insight: Age seems to play a role, with middle-aged individuals being the dominant group of buyers. Older individuals may prefer other modes of transportation or may not find cycling as attractive due to age-related factors.
**4. Marital Status**
The dataset shows that both single and married individuals buy bikes, but the income patterns between the two groups differ.
Married individuals tend to have a higher income than single buyers on average.
However, being single or married doesn’t appear to strongly correlate with bike purchase decisions.
Insight: While income is higher for married individuals, marital status alone may not significantly affect bike purchasing behavior.
**5. Commute Distance**
Commute distance seems to have some impact on bike purchasing behavior:
Buyers often live relatively close to their workplaces, with many falling within the "0-1 Miles" and "2-5 Miles" commute range.
Longer commutes (5-10 Miles) are less common among bike buyers.
Insight: People with shorter commutes are more likely to buy bikes, likely because biking is a more viable and convenient option for short-distance travel.
**6. Occupation and Education**
Certain occupations, like professionals, are more likely to buy bikes than others (e.g., clerical workers).
Individuals with higher education levels, such as those with bachelor's degrees, are more common among bike buyers.
Insight: Education and occupation may contribute to bike purchases, with more educated, professional individuals appearing more likely to buy bikes.
**Conclusion**
The analysis reveals that factors like income, age, commute distance, and gender influence bike purchasing behavior, though in unexpected ways. Higher income, particularly for males, does not correlate with higher bike purchase rates, suggesting that lifestyle, convenience, and other motivations are key factors.
